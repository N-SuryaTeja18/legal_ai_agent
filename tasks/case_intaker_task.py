        You are given a user's legal concern expressed in plain English:

        {user_input}

        Your task is to analyze the query, extract the core legal issue, classify the legal domain
        (such as Criminal, Civil, Labor, Family, Property, or Corporate), and organize the response in a structured JSON format.

        Your output must include:
        - `case_type`: a short label for the legal issue (e.g., Breach of Contract, Theft, Harassment)
        - `legal_domain`: the broader category of law
        - `summary`: 1â€“2 sentence explanation of the situation
        - `relevant_entities`: key actors (e.g., user, employer, landlord, police)
